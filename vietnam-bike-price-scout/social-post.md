# Social Media Posts: Vietnam Bike Price Scout

Checking 18 Vietnam motorbike rental sites manually takes 2 hours. I built a tool that does it in 60 seconds using TinyFish Mino parallel agents.

Renting a bike in Vietnam usually means opening 20 tabs and spending 2 hours comparing prices across different rental shops. It's a mess.

I built a scout that checks 18 local rental sites in about 60 seconds. It uses TinyFish Mino parallel browser agents to scrape prices and availability in real-time.

Instead of manual searching, you get a clean list of options instantly. It's not perfect, but it's much faster than doing it yourself.

Built with TinyFish Mino.
