# Chi Wang — Speaker Brief for AI Tinkerers HCMC (March 7)

> Event: **AI Tinkerers HCMC: "From Prompt to Agent"** | March 7, 2026 | 2–5PM | W Business Center
> Target: **Chi Wang** — DeepMind researcher, creator of AutoGen/AG2, founder of Orion

---

## TL;DR

- Chi Wang built AutoGen (now AG2) — one of the most used multi-agent frameworks in the world. He's now building Orion, a desktop app that orchestrates AI agents across your devices.
- The event topic "From Prompt to Agent" is literally his life's work.
- You're not cold-pitching — you and Chi Wang share the **SnowX / Khoi Nguyen** network. He's seen your name. Details below.
- He has an NSF workshop at UCLA on March 13 (6 days after your event) — no conflict, but he'll be busy that week. Reach out ASAP.

## Your Connection Path

You and Chi Wang are in the same professional orbit through **Khoi Nguyen** (SnowX / Zinley):

**Evidence:**
1. Chi Wang reshared Khoi Nguyen's post about SnowX's multi-agent medical AI product — **both you and Chi Wang were tagged in it** ([LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chi-wang-autogen_thrilled-to-see-a-strong-agentic-ai-product-activity-7337896213167382530-8oOx))
2. Chi Wang posted about SnowX's MassGen demo — **you were both tagged again** ([LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chi-wang-autogen_very-cool-can-anyone-use-this-to-build-a-activity-7359992264154099712-sa5l))

Chi Wang chose to reshare those posts. He's seen your name. This isn't cold outreach — you can reference the shared SnowX/AG2 community as common ground.

**Additional bridge:** Yong Quan Tan (AI Tinkerers Singapore) is a mutual connection. Mentioning the AI Tinkerers network adds credibility.

## What He's Been Up To (Last 30 Days)

| When | What | Why It Matters |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Feb 24** | Posted "One AI agent. One month. 110 tasks. 5 devices. 37 skills." — a 30-day Orion stress test including phone calls, meeting attendance, music videos, email management | He's in active Orion launch/promo mode. A talk = more exposure for his product. |
| **Feb 27** | AG2 v0.11.2 released (5 releases in 6 weeks) | The OSS project is in a shipping sprint. He's deep in builder mode. |
| **~Late Jan** | Posted about "AG2 AgentOS" — reframing AG2 as an enterprise "operating space for AI-native teams" | New narrative: not just a framework, but an OS for organizations. |
| **~Jan 13** | Announced NSF Workshop at UCLA (March 13) on "Agents for Chip Design Automation" — he's co-organizing with Google, Nvidia, Synopsys | He has a March 13 commitment. Your event is March 7 — no conflict, but the month is packed. |

**Current energy:** He's promoting Orion hard and shipping AG2 fast. A speaking slot that lets him demo Orion to 100+ Southeast Asian builders is aligned with what he's already doing.

## The OpenClaw Comparison (Worth Knowing)

His main competitor is **OpenClaw** (openclaw.ai) by Peter Steinberger — open-source, 237K GitHub stars, 370 contributors.

| | Orion | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| Source | Closed, proprietary | MIT license, open-source |
| Setup | Download → works in 60 seconds | Self-host, configure API keys |
| Phone calls | Core feature (10K+ calls made) | Not native |
| Cross-device | Built-in | Manual setup |
| Community | Discord, Reddit | 237K stars, 370 contributors |

The interesting tension: Chi Wang created AutoGen (open-source), then built Orion (closed). If the conversation goes there, a good question:

> "You built one of the most successful open-source agent frameworks, then went closed with Orion. What can you build with a closed product that an open-source community can't?"

## Draft Messages

### Option A: Short DM (X or LinkedIn)

> Hey Chi — we've crossed paths through the SnowX/AG2 community (Khoi Nguyen's posts). I'm hosting AI Tinkerers Ho Chi Minh City on March 7th — the theme is "From Prompt to Agent."
>
> Your 30-day Orion stress test post was exactly the kind of thing this audience wants to hear about. Would you be up for a talk or live demo? Remote works if travel doesn't.
>
> 100+ engineers and founders, builder crowd. Luma: https://luma.com/zmqppyeb

### Option B: Slightly Longer (LinkedIn)

> Hi Chi,
>
> I run AI Tinkerers in Ho Chi Minh City and Viet Engineers Stories — we've been in the same SnowX/AG2 orbit through Khoi Nguyen's work.
>
> Our March 7th event is themed "From Prompt to Agent" — multi-agent orchestration, tool-calling reliability, agent supervision. Basically everything you've been building with AG2 and Orion.
>
> Your recent post about running one agent across 5 devices for 110 tasks in a month — that's a talk our audience would love to unpack. Format options:
> - 20–30 min talk + Q&A
> - Live Orion demo
> - Fireside chat (I'd moderate)
> - Remote/virtual if March 7th travel doesn't work
>
> 100+ engineers, researchers, and founders. AI Tinkerers runs in 200+ cities — strong talks get visibility across the network.
>
> Open to it?

### Option C: The Orion Angle

> Chi — I'm running AI Tinkerers HCMC on March 7th ("From Prompt to Agent"). Vietnam's builder community is growing fast and there's real interest in agent orchestration here.
>
> After seeing your 30-day Orion experiment, I think a live demo would blow this crowd away — the phone calls, cross-device coordination, autonomous operation. This audience wants implementation details, not marketing.
>
> Remote works. What do you think?

## Talk Format Options

### 30-min Talk + Q&A
**"Orchestration Is the New Bottleneck"** — evolution from single agents to multi-agent systems, architecture decisions, the Sensor system, live Orion demo, open questions.

### Live Demo (20 min + 25 min discussion)
**"From Research Paper to Phone Call"** — live Orion demo (phone calls, cross-device, Claude Code orchestration), under-the-hood architecture, what breaks and how they handle it.

### Fireside Chat (45 min)
**"From Prompt to Agent"** — why prompt engineering isn't enough, multi-agent vs single-agent, on-device vs cloud, the gap between research demos and production agents, audience Q&A.

### Remote / Virtual
Any of the above over video. A remote Orion demo still works — he can show phone calls and cross-device coordination from his setup in Redmond.

## If He Can't Make It

Ask him to recommend someone:
1. **Khoi Nguyen** — SnowX founder, built on AG2, Vietnamese-connected
2. **Octavian Boji** — Orion co-founder (18yo, unique perspective)
3. **AG2 core contributors** — Chi Wang could connect you with someone from the community
4. **Peter Steinberger** (@steipete) — OpenClaw creator, different angle on same topic

Also: offer to slot him into a future AI Tinkerers HCMC event if March 7 doesn't work.
